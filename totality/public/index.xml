      <title>Why IPFS</title>

      <description>I wrote here how this blog is built. The better question - thanks Aman! - is why? Why not post on medium, or put a static site on github pages or an S3 bucket, or use a virtual private server, or even go super old-school and run a web server at home (I do have this sweet, sweet Sonic fiber after all).
And, just to get this out of the way, part of the reason I did it this way is because I am a huge nerd, and this technology is new, and interesting, and I wanted to.</description>

      <title>Value Stacking</title>
      <link>https://teetotality.blog/posits/value-stacking/</link>

      <description>One of the themes here is that the over-specialization of elite knowledge is going to get us all killed. Or at least make things harder as we transition to a sustainable civilization.
Example: the energy systems jargon term &amp;ldquo;value stacking&amp;rdquo;, which means &amp;ldquo;having the capability to perform multiple energy services at the same time&amp;rdquo;. #
I&#39;m no expert on this stuff - that&#39;s the point! - but this term has turned me off for reasons I have struggled to articulate.</description>

      <description>2009 2016 2019           I&#39;m a collection of verbs in a world of nouns. Emo but true. I have performed research in neuroscience and Bayesian machine learning, but I am not a neuroscientist. I have co-founded a couple companies, but I am not an entrepreneur. I have looked at, modeled, and wrangled a lot of data, but I am not a data scientist.</description>
