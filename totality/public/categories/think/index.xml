      <description>One of the themes here is that the over-specialization of elite knowledge is going to get us all killed. Or at least make things harder as we transition to a sustainable civilization.
Example: the energy systems jargon term &amp;ldquo;value stacking&amp;rdquo;, which means &amp;ldquo;having the capability to perform multiple energy services at the same time&amp;rdquo;. #
I&#39;m no expert on this stuff - that&#39;s the point! - but this term has turned me off for reasons I have struggled to articulate.</description>
