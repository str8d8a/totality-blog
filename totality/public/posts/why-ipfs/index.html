				<h1 class="post__title">Why IPFS</h1>
				<div class="post__content"><p>I wrote <a href="https://teetotality.blog/posts/how-this-blog-was-made/">here</a> how this blog is built. The better question - thanks Aman! - is why? Why not post on medium, or put a static site on github pages or an S3 bucket, or use a virtual private server, or even go super old-school and run a web server at home (I do have this sweet, sweet <a href="https://www.sonic.com/gigabit-fiber-internet">Sonic fiber</a> after all).</p>
<p>And, just to get this out of the way, part of the reason I did it this way is because I am a huge nerd, and this technology is new, and interesting, and I wanted to. But that's just part of the story - there's lots of new and interesting technology out there, and I don't have time to kick all of the tires.</p>
<p>What are the more specific motivations?</p>
<p>As many have noted, the internet as we know it is flawed in several fundamental ways. It is easy for bad actors to do bad things, from sending too many emails to flooding websites with traffic. IPFS is, at best, part of the solution to some of these problems. It does not, on its own, cure the internet's ails. For that, you need bitcoin. I kid, I kid.</p>
<p>The main change that IPFS makes relative to the &ldquo;old&rdquo; internet is in how web pages are named.</p>
