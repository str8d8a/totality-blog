				<div class="post__content"><p>The ability to sense and adapt to a dynamic environment is universal, under-appreciated, and essential to survival.</p>
<p><strong>All organisms sense their environment and respond as best they can in order to maximize their chances of survival.</strong> This includes bacteria, many of which can detect changes in chemical concentration and behave accordingly: they swim toward good chemicals, such as food, and away from bad ones. Basic, but effective: at the scale on which these creatures operate, this behavior does a great job at promoting survival and reproduction.</p>
<p>If bacteria — brainless, microscopic, single-celled — can sense their environment and respond by navigating appropriately, should I be less impressed with my driving fu? <strong>We constantly overlook the pervasive genius of animal perceptual systems, because we’re so good at moving through the world that we usually take it for granted.</strong> It wasn’t until we attempted to recreate intelligent behavior in computers that we came to terms with the profound physical and computational difficulty in understanding and navigating the world. That challenge persists to this day: at the dawn of the 2020’s, an artificial intelligence can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985260/ai-go-alphago-lee-se-dol-retired-deepmind-defeat">force the world’s best Go player into despair and early retirement</a>, but self-driving cars are still <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/11/07/777438412/feds-say-self-driving-uber-suv-did-not-recognize-jaywalking-pedestrian-in-fatal-">baffled by jaywalkers</a>. Maybe my skill behind the wheel is worth celebrating after all.</p>
<p>In fact, <strong>we should extend much more respect to any system that processes information from its surroundings and responds to preserve itself.</strong> While each of us, as an individual animal, is amazing in this regard, our collective work is much less impressive; we have, as yet, none of God’s finesse. Yes, our species as a whole is impressively adaptive, and our smaller collectives are quite robust; cities, in particular, exhibit many of the key properties of systems that survive under changing circumstances. But our largest agglomerations of people, energy and materials — empires, regimes, dynasties — follow a certain trajectory: they coalesce, grow, hollow out, and then collapse.</p>
<p>As a rule, <strong>concentrated human societies have not had enough awareness of their situation to avert this outcome.</strong> - empires rise and fall. Even if far-sighted individuals have understood the truth of environmental constraints, their individual knowledge does not transfer to the system as a whole.</p>
