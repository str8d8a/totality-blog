My daughters and I almost died this morning as I drove them to school.

I should really say that we had a near death experience — several, in fact. Picture this: traveling down a side street, I stopped at an intersection with a major artery and let a bus pass in front of us. If we had been even a few feet further forward, certain death. But it didn’t end there. A couple minutes later, I waited just long enough for another car to clear the intersection before making a left turn. Even a second earlier, that same turn would have meant shattered glass, crumpled sheet metal, smashed bodies — we barely avoided that tragedy. Just after that close call, I nearly killed a woman crossing the street: she was in the crosswalk, and if I hadn’t thought to apply the brake and stop for a red light she would have been maimed or killed on the hood of our car.

And that’s not even a full accounting! Every few seconds, I acted just in time to avert catastrophe. It was, frankly, a miraculous ballet of steel and flesh.

This is a silly way to talk - of course we didn’t die. I acted unthinkingly in accordance with our survival and on-time arrival, aided by others’ compliance with the formal and informal rules of the road. I experienced no adrenaline spikes, no life-flashing-before-my-eyes, no slowing of time - none of the markers of traumatic events. We are all near death, all the time. Access to it is always at hand, often mere feet or seconds away. And in many cases, it is not merely that we must refrain from a dangerous act, but that we must take positive – though often routine – action to avoid harm. It is failure to act, staying put, business as usual, that puts us at grave risk.
